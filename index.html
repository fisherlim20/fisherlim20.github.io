            <p>
                My name is Xiao Yu Lim (S3622764), and currently, I am studying a Bachelor of Information Technology in RMIT. This is my second-year first semester for this course. I did Bachelor of Computer Science since February 2017, and I changed to Bachelor of Information Technology since July 2018. The reason I changed to Bachelor of Information Technology is I realised I am not a software programmer. Therefore I found it is hard for me to continue with Bachelor of Computer Science.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                I am an international student from Ipoh, Malaysia. As a Malaysian Chinese, we usually speak more than three languages, which are Malay, English, and Chinese. Furthermore, one of the fact about myself is that I can speak five languages, such as Malay, English, Chinese, Cantonese, and Hokkien.
            </p>
            
            <h2 id="interest_it">Interest in IT</h2>
            <p>
                My interest in IT is the hardware part, develop a new website, and the server side. Since I was young, I went to a Computer Tuition Centre back in Malaysia, and from there, my interest in IT begun. Currently, I am a student who is studying a Bachelor of IT in RMIT, and at the same time, I am also working part-time as an IT Support Officer in a student agency. My job scope as this position is developing the new website for the company and also answer all IT related question. Furthermore, I used to be an IT director at RMIT University Malaysian Association (RUMA).
                
            </p>
                
            <p>
                RMIT University is always my dream university since young. In a coincidence, my study agent did introduce me to further study in RMIT. Therefore, I choose RMIT to further my study.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                I am expecting to learn more knowledge about IT throughout my study in RMIT, especially something related to the server side. Moreover, I also hope that after studying IT in RMIT, I can work in an IT company to help them with the technical problem especially hardware and server side.

                From the test result, I know that I am an extrovert, visual learner, and more suitable to work in an organised environment such as a librarian. To work as a team, I think I will be good at organising meeting, events, be the secretary who drops down everything about the company, etc. When forming a team, I will be looking someone creative and investigative, so that we can be a good team among others. Also, since I am good at organising; therefore, I will nominate myself to be the team leader and lead everyone to achieve the achievement at the end.
