						<h2>Personal Information</h2>
						<p>My name is Xiao Yu Lim (S3622764), and currently I'm studying Bachelor of Information Technology in RMIT. This is my second year first semester for this course. I did Bachelor of Computer Science since February 2017, and I changed to Bachelor of Information Technology since July 2018. The reason I change to Bachelor of Information Technology is I realised I am not a software programmer, therefore I found it is hard for me to continue with Bachelor of Computer Science.<br/><br/>I am an international student from Ipoh, Malaysia. As a Malaysian Chinese, normally we can speak more than 3 languages, which are Malay, English, and Chinese. Furthermore, one of the fact about myself is I can speak 5 languages, such as Malay, English, Chinese, Cantonese, and Hokkien.</p>

Since I was young, I went to a Computer Tuition Centre back in Malaysia, and from there, my interest in IT begun. Currently, I am a student who is studying Bachelor of IT in RMIT, and at the same time, I am also working part time as an IT Support Officer in a student agency. My job scope as this position are developing the new website for the company and also answer all IT related question. Furthermore, I used to be IT director in RMIT University Malaysian Association (RUMA).<br/><br/>RMIT University is always my dream university since young. In coincidence, my study agent did introduced me to further study in RMIT. Therefore, I choose RMIT to further my study.<br/><br/>I am expecting to learn more knowledge about IT throughout my study in RMIT, especially something related to the server side. Moreover, I also hope that after studying IT in RMIT, I am able to work in an IT company to help them with the technical problem especially hardware and server side.</p>
